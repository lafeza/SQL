# SQL
contains study of structured quality language (SQL) using postgreSQL
My name is Femi Yusuff, I have taken extensive courses in Excel, PowerBI and SQL
In the Excel course I learnt skills such as using various charts, use of Sparklines and data visualization
In power BI, I learnt about structured presentation of data, editing columns and data transformation
In SQL, I learnt about the use of SQL language to transform data to achieve specific results
My SQL Capstone project was particularly interesting. The first phase of the project focused on the
design of database that will store customer information, track transactions, manage loans and record loan payments
The second phase of the SQL project focused on a project to idnetify patterns and insights about vehicle thefts
I carried out an analysis to find out information such as the day of the week with most stoley vehicles,
types of deleverables that are most stolen and average age of vehicles that are stole. 
After a challenging project or a hard day's work, I relax by 
Swimming,
Playing Squash,
and Watching movies

I also like taking fruits such as Apple, Mango and Oranges to keep healthy.
